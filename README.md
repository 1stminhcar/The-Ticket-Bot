# Tickets-Bot

### Please note that this bot is an modified instance of [Tovade's Ticket Bot](https://github.com/tovade/Ticket-Bot), So Credits to the Original Owner: @tovade

### A simple Tickets Bot made using Discord.js v12 and MongoDB
- This bot can be setup for multiple servers unlike, its orginal version.
- This bot is completely reaction controlled. Just complete the setup and you're ready to go!
- I will soon update the code to be compatible with Discord.js V13.

### Configuration

- Clone this repo (Download or fork the repo)
- Fill the required values in the `config.json` file
```json
{
    "token": "bot token",
    "dburl": "mongo db url"
}
```
- Enter your bot token in `token`
- Enter the MongoDB url in `dburl`

### Hosting
- If you are hosting on repl or glitch, contact me on discord for free hosting (Link in Profile)
- Or you can host this repo wherever you want!

### No LICENSE Because I don't own this code, I have just modified it to be used for multiple servers!
### Stay tuned for more updates to this repo!

### Every fork and star is appreciated!
